Odyssey 2 core for openFPGA on Analogue Pocket
-

Enjoy Odyssey 2 games with this core.  The Voice is fully supported.

To use it, you must place the 2048 byte Odyssey 2 BIOS named `o2bios.bin` here:
`/Assets/odyssey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/o2bios.bin`

If you wish to use The Voice, the two voice 16384 byte files need to be placed here:
`/Assets/odyssey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/SP128_03.BIN`
`/Assets/odyssey2/Spiritualized.Odyssey2/SP128_04.BIN`

This core really benefits from a keyboard.

The keyboard is fully supported using a USB keyboard through the dock.

Most stuff directly maps. The following special symbols map like so:

0-9 directly maps to 0-9
A-Z directly maps to A-Z, except N and Y which are also "No" and "Yes"
=, +, -, x, and <divide> map to =, +, -, * and /
?, space, and enter map directly to ?, space and enter
clr is mapped to backspace

This keyboard does not support shifting, but to type some of the symbols
you will need to use shift on the USB keyboard, i.e. ? and + and *.

Controller 1 maps some keys to make playing games possible without a keyboard:

start - 1
select - 2
A - 3
X - 4
L trig - enter
R trig - clear
